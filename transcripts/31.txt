Customer: Well, you see, I placed an order for a new laptop about a week ago, and it still hasn't arrived. I'm starting to get a bit worried, and I was hoping you could look into it for me.

Agent: Absolutely, let me take a look. Could you please provide me with the email address you used to place the order, and I'll pull up the details?

Agent: I understand your concern. Let me look into the status of your order for you. *typing* Hmm, it appears there may have been a slight delay in the shipping process. *pauses* Oh, I see here that the package was actually returned to us due to an issue with the delivery address.
