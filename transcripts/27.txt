Agent: Thank you for calling Oktank customer support. This is {NAME}, how may I assist you today?

Customer: Hi, I'm so confused right now. I've been a loyal Oktank customer for years, and I just received an email about a promotional offer, but I'm not sure I understand it correctly.

Agent: I'm happy to help clarify the promotional offer for you. Could I please have your email address and a one-time password to verify your account?

Customer: Oh, yes, of course. My email is [email protected], and the one-time password is {PASSWORD}.

Agent: Thank you for providing that information. Let me pull up your account details. *types on keyboard* Okay, I see the promotional offer you received. Could you tell me what part of it is confusing you?

Customer: Well, the email said I could get 50% off my next purchase, but it also mentioned something about a limited-time window. I'm not sure if that means I have to use the discount right away or if I can use it later.

Agent: I understand your concern. The 50% off promotion is valid for the next 30 days from the date of the email. So you have until [date] to take advantage of the discount on your next purchase.
