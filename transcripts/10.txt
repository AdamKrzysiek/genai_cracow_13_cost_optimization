Agent: *Calmly* No need to apologize, I'm here to help. Let me pull up your account information. *Typing sounds* Alright, I see your recent order for the [product name]. What seems to be the issue with the item?

Customer: *Distressed* Well, the thing is, I really needed this product for a very important event this weekend, but when it arrived, it was completely damaged. I'm so upset and I don't know what to do. I have to return it, but I'm worried I won't get my money back in time. I really can't afford to lose that money right now.

Agent: *Empathetic* I understand this is a stressful situation. Let me assure you that we will do our best to process your return request as quickly as possible. Can you tell me a bit more about the damage to the item? That will help me determine the best way to handle this for you.

Customer: *Anxious* The product was completely crushed when it arrived. The packaging was all smashed up and the item itself was broken beyond repair. I'm just so disappointed because I was really counting on having this for a special event this weekend. I don't know what I'm going to do now.

Agent: *Calming* I'm very sorry to hear that the item arrived damaged. That must have been so frustrating, especially with the event coming up this weekend. Let me go ahead and initiate the return process for you. *Typing sounds* Okay, I've started the return request and I can see that the item qualifies for a full refund. 

Now, to ensure you receive the refund as quickly as possible, I'd like to verify your payment method. Could you please provide the last four digits of the card you used for the original purchase?

Customer: *Relieved* Oh, thank goodness. The last four digits are {CREDIT_DEBIT_CARD_NUMBER}. I'm just so relieved you're able to help me with this. I was really worried I'd be stuck with a broken product and no money to replace it.

Agent: *Reassuring* I understand how stressful that must have been. We want to make sure our customers are taken care of, so I'm glad we can get this resolved for you quickly. *Typing sounds* Alright, I've processed the return and the full refund has been issued. You should see the credit back on your card within 3-5 business days.

Customer: *Grateful* Thank you so much, I really appreciate your help. This has been such a difficult week for me, and I was so worried about this return.
