Customer: *Sighs* Alright, that's good to know. *Pause* Wait, I'm sorry, the connection seems to be breaking up. Can you hear me okay?

Agent: *Calmly* Yes, I can hear you, but the connection does seem a bit spotty. Let me try to improve the call quality on my end. *Pause* How's that? Can you hear me better now?

Customer: *Frustrated* Ugh, it's still cutting in and out. This is so frustrating! *Sighs* Okay, let me try moving to a different location.

Agent: *Patiently* No problem, take your time. I'm happy to wait while you find a better spot with a stronger connection.

*Pause, with muffled sounds of the customer moving around*

Customer: *Clearer* Alright, I think this is better. Can you hear me now?

Agent: *Calmly* Yes, the connection is much clearer now. I'm glad you were able to find a better spot. Now, where were we? Ah, yes, I've initiated the return request for the [product name], and I'll make sure the refund is processed as quickly as possible once we receive the item.
