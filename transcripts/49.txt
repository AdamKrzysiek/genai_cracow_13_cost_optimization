Agent: Great, thank you. And just to confirm, you'd like to return the Oktank Horizon 15 laptop and receive a full refund, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's correct. I'd really appreciate a full refund, if possible.

Agent: Absolutely, {NAME}. I'll go ahead and initiate the return request for you. Once I have the laptop back, we'll process the refund to the original payment method you used. Does that sound good?
