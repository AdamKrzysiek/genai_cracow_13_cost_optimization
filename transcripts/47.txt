First, I'll need the order number or invoice number associated with your purchase of the Oktank Deluxe Blender. Do you have that information handy?

Customer: Yes, the order number is 12345.

Agent: Wonderful, thank you. I've pulled up the details for your order. Okay, so the next step is for you to package up the blender and send it back to us. I can provide you with the return shipping label and instructions.

Customer: That would be great, I really appreciate you walking me through this.

Agent: Not a problem at all, {NAME}. I'm happy to guide you through the process. Once you have the item packaged up, you can either print the return label I'll email you or schedule a free pickup with one of our carriers. Just let me know which option works best for you.

Agent: Absolutely, we can definitely arrange a free pickup for you. I'll get that scheduled right away. What day and time would work best for you?

Customer: Hmm, let me check my calendar... Would tomorrow afternoon around 2 pm work?
