Customer: Well, actually, there is one thing. I noticed that the shipping cost for this order was a bit higher than usual. I was wondering if there was any way to get a credit or refund for the difference?

Agent: Certainly, {NAME}. Let me look into that for you. *typing* Okay, I've pulled up the details of your recent order. It appears that due to the size and weight of the items you purchased, the shipping cost was slightly higher than our standard rates. However, as a valued Oktank customer, I'd be happy to issue a credit to your account to cover the difference.

Customer: Oh, that would be wonderful! I really appreciate you looking into that for me.

Agent: It's my pleasure, {NAME}. Your satisfaction is extremely important to us. *typing* Alright, I've processed a credit of $5.99 to your account to cover the difference in shipping costs. You should see that reflected in your next statement.
